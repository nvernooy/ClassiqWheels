    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Classiq Wheels is an online car dealership that buys old classic cars, refurbishes them and sells them to clients
         both locally and internationally. We have distribution houses in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg. The store
         is under the management of four entrepreneurs who came up with the idea to start this business due to their love
         of classic cars. Cars are selected carefully and they go through specific tests before they are purchased from
         the owners to ensure that they are still of good quality. Classiq Wheels holds the edge over our competitors by
         specializing in a particular range of cars, rather than other car dealerships that manufacture or sell modern cars. 
        Classiq Wheels primarily conducts its business online due to the rising popularity of online shopping. It is
         convenient, time-saving and allows us to reach more customers. The company headquarters is in Cape Town but there
         are two other branches in the country, one in Johannesburg the other in Durban. You can like our page on Facebook
         or follow us on Twitter to get the latest updates and deals.</p>
