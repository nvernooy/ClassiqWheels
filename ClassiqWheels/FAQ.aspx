    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>What kind of cars do you sell?</dt>
        <dd>
            We will primarily stock sporty cars from the 60’s like the 1966 Shelby 427 Cobra and 1964 Aston Martin DB5. 
            Furthermore we are always on the lookout for iconic cars from other eras, or any other classic model that’s
             of interest to our clients.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />Where do you get the cars you sell?</dt>
        <dd>
            Our cars are sourced from all over the world. Some we get from local businesses and individuals, others we 
            get from overseas suppliers. We search hard to find the best and most desirable models for our customers. 
        </dd>
        <dt><br />I want a car that is not in your catalogue, can I order it specifically?</dt>
        <dd>
            We try to provide a varied selection to our customers, but obviously we cannot stock all cars. If a specific
             car is in high demand we will work to supply it. But for specific, scarce, models we require a percentage 
            deposit that is refunded if the model is not found. Requests can be mailed to info@classiqwheels.co.za
        </dd>
        <dt><br />What is the condition of the cars you are selling?</dt>
        <dd>
            Not all the vehicles we source are in their best condition, but we have our own specialist mechanics who 
            scrutinize each car, and fixes any issues found. Every cars we sell we guarantee to be in top working condition.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />Is the car I ordered safe while it is being delivered?</dt>
        <dd>
            We take every care to insure that the cars are delivered to our clients in the exact same condition that they
             were ordered in. But if any issues arise our cars are insured, and our clients will be reimbursed for any loss.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />My order is taking long to arrive, how can I check up on it?</dt>
        <dd>
             When a client places an order, they are given a unique code. The code corresponds to the GPS tracker placed on
             the order. This is done with every car delivered to our clients. Clients can then look up the exact position 
            of their delivery using their unique code on a third party website.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />I’m not satisfied with my purchase, can I return it?</dt>
        <dd>
            If you are not completely happy with your purchase, you are able to return it and Classiq Wheels will refund you. 
            However, it needs to be returned within five working days, and be in the same condition that it was delivered in.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />Where is your head office?</dt>
        <dd>
            Although nearly all our business is conducted online, the owners and head office is based in Cape Town. 
            For appointments please schedule via email first.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />Is there any way to see the cars in person?</dt>
        <dd>
            Our warehouses in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban are not open to the public due to security reasons. However, 
            for clients making large purchases who want to see the cars in person first, we do allow visits accompanied by 
            Classiq Wheels staff.
        </dd>
        <dt><br />I have questions not listed here, where can I ask them?</dt>
        <dd>
            Any further questions, inquiries, or comments can be mailed to <a href='mailto:support@classiqwheels.co.za'>support@classiqwheels.co.za</a>
